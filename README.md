# ROS2 Launch Tutorial

Hello! I just started with ROS2 and came across some hurdles in understanding the working behind the launch files. I saw that everyone uses their 
own style for the launch file layout. I have tried here to combine the different layouts into one which works really well.

Additionally, I have added some example usages for the commonly used modules. The launch file showcases the usage of the following modules:

LaunchDescription  
Node  
FindPackageShare  
PathJoinSubstitution  
DeclareLaunchArgument  
OpaqueFunction  
Command   
FindExecutable   
LaunchConfiguration  
IfCondition  

Please feel free to add new options to this so that we have a single usecase example for the launch file capabilities.
